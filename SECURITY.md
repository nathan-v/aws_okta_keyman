# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

AWS Okta Keyman handles authentication and given that there's certainly concerns about security. Given how this project
has been written and that it runs locally and is user-driven it's highly unlikely that there is going to be a security
vulnerability in the project that requires private disclosure. In such a case, however, please 
[contact](https://www.nathanv.com/contact) me directly.
